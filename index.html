            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif, serif;font-size:large;font-weight: 200;">
               I am Ballala Pavan Kumar, a Civil Engineering graduate with a strong academic foundation and practical experience in construction and project execution. I completed my B.Tech in Civil Engineering from Narayana Engineering College, Nellore, where I gained knowledge in structural design, building materials, and construction management. My academic background is supported by my schooling at St. Anthonyâ€™s EM High School and Sri Chaitanya Junior College (+2).

During my final year of engineering, I successfully executed a G+2 residential building project using SketchUp software, which involved structural planning, 3D visualization, and attending site visits to understand real-time construction practices.

I bring 1 year of professional experience as a Site Engineer at Studio Arcade (ITPL), where I was responsible for supervising construction activities, ensuring adherence to safety and quality standards, coordinating with contractors, and monitoring daily progress reports. This role enhanced my technical expertise, leadership skills, and ability to manage site operations efficiently.

                <p>During the middle of my B.Tech program, I had the opportunity to actively participate in a project that involved a site visit focused on foundation work. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

At the site, I observed and engaged in various stages of foundation construction, including soil excavation, leveling, setting out, reinforcement placement, shuttering, and concreting. I gained hands-on exposure to how drawings and designs are implemented in the field and understood the importance of accuracy in measurements, quality control of materials, and adherence to safety standards.</p>

                <p>During my B.Tech program, I had the opportunity to work on a project involving the design and visualization of a residential building using 3D modeling software. This project helped me bridge the gap between classroom concepts of structural design and their practical application in modern architectural planning.

Through this exercise, I learned how to create detailed 3D models, including walls, windows, doors, balconies, and roofing systems. I gained exposure to how architectural drawings are converted into digital models, which provide clarity for both engineers and clients. This process highlighted the importance of precision in dimensions, selection of materials, and design aesthetics, as well as how these digital models assist in minimizing errors before execution on-site.

Overall, this experience enhanced my technical understanding of building design, improved my visualization skills, and gave me practical insight into how digital tools support the real-world construction process.</p>
